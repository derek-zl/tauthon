Executor.submit() called:
- creates a uniquely numbered _WorkItem and adds it to the "Work Items" dict
- adds the id of the _WorkItem to the "Work Ids" queue

Local worker thread:
- reads work ids from the "Work Ids" queue and looks up the corresponding
  WorkItem from the "Work Items" dict: if the work item has been cancelled then
  it is simply removed from the dict, otherwise it is repackaged as a
  _CallItem and put in the "Call Q". New _CallItems are put in the "Call Q"
  until "Call Q" is full. NOTE: the size of the "Call Q" is kept small because
  calls placed in the "Call Q" can no longer be cancelled with Future.cancel().
- reads _ResultItems from "Result Q", updates the future stored in the
  "Work Items" dict and deletes the dict entry

Process #1..n:
- reads _CallItems from "Call Q", executes the calls, and puts the resulting
  _ResultItems in "Result Q"

# Workers are created as daemon threads and processes. This is done to allow the
# interpreter to exit when there are still idle processes in a
# ProcessPoolExecutor's process pool (i.e. shutdown() was not called). However,
# allowing workers to die with the interpreter has two undesirable properties:
#   - The workers would still be running during interpretor shutdown,
#     meaning that they would fail in unpredictable ways.
#   - The workers could be killed while evaluating a work item, which could
#     be bad if the callable being evaluated has external side-effects e.g.
#     writing to a file.
#
# To work around this problem, an exit handler is installed which tells the
# workers to exit when their work queues are empty and then waits until the
# threads/processes finish.

            chunksize: If greater than one, the iterables will be chopped into
                chunks of size chunksize and submitted to the process pool.
                If set to one, the items in the list will be sent one at a time.

        Returns:
            An iterator equivalent to: map(func, *iterables) but the calls may
            be evaluated out-of-order.

            TimeoutError: If the entire result iterator could not be generated
                before the given timeout.
            Exception: If fn(*args) raises for any values.
